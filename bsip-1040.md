# **Abstract**

# **Motivation**

The ability to hold assets within a hashed and time locked contract within BitShares is a desirable feature that could be used by many persons, services, and businesses. It permits conditional transfers between parties that minimize or eliminate risks to a depositor/sender. Conditions for completion of a transfer are evident to both parties. No third-party escrow agent is necessary (unless you consider the BitShares blockchain a third-party to the transaction). 

# **Rational**

## **Elements of an HTLC**

An HTLC is defined to have the following elements:

* parties to the HTLC

    * The depositor

    * The recipient

* Asset that is being escrowed

* Escrow period end (expiry)

* Preimage

* Fee

### **Parties**

Two parties must be defined for an escrow contract: one depositor, and one intended recipient. Note that a proposal can be used for tasks such as multi-signature, but the end result at approval is still one depositor and one recipient.

### **Escrow Asset**

An escrow involves a conditional transfer of ownership of a quantity of one item from one party (a depositor) to another (a recipient). The HTLC is used to temporarily hold a certain amount of the asset while the condition is being evaluated during the escrow period. The funds are unable to be used (a.k.a "held") until the escrow conditions are satisfied. Upon satisfaction of the hash condition, the quantity of the escrowed item will be transferred to the intended recipient. If the hash condition is not satisfied by the expiry then the quantity is to be returned to the asset balance of the depositor when requested.

### **Conditions**

There are two competing conditions to an HTLC. The hash lock and the time lock.

The contract has a hash stored within it. If a preimage is provided that generates a hash that matches the stored hash, the preimage is then stored within the blockchain, and the asset is transferred to the recipient account mentioned in the original contract.

If no preimage is provided before the time stipulated in the contract, the sender can request the return of funds. This will transfer the asset back to its original account.

### **Condition Evaluators**

The preimage can be thought of a secret key, that will eventually be shared with the recipient. This can be a word, a phrase, or even a random series of bytes. The length of the preimage must be shared and stored in the HTLC object.

Upon presentation of the preimage, the evaluator validates 

1. That the timeout of the contract has not yet occurred.

2. That its length matches the length stored in the HTLC object. 

3. That the hash of the preimage matches the hash stored in the contract. 

If the evaluation succeeds, the asset is transferred to the recipient account. If the evaluation fails, nothing happens.

Upon presentation of a request from the sender for return of funds, the evaluator validates that the timeout of the contract is now in the past. It then returns the funds to the original account.

### **Timing of Condition Evaluation**

The timeout of the contract is user-selectable. It can be any time in the future. The accuracy is based on when the evaluator runs, and should be considered accurate Â± 15 seconds.

### **Early Termination of an Escrow Contract**

To protect the recipient, early termination of an escrow contract is not allowed. Placing a timeout far into the future is valid. User protection from locking up funds for an extremely long period could be provided by the UI used to create the contract.

### **Automatic Transfers Upon Expiry**

Upon expiry of the evaluation period, the assets that are held by the blockchain will not automatically be returned to their depositors. A separate transaction must be initiated by the sender to return the funds to their account. 

Code COULD be added to automate the return of funds. It could be part of block production or maintenance. But this will cause an extra load on those processes. Hence, it is felt that requiring user action is a better option.

### **Fee**

Creating and fulfillment are two operations that add data to the blockchain. The fees for these operations are based on the standards set for blocks, and are similar to costs of other items stored on-chain.

## **Existing Escrow Proposals**

The section describes various escrow concepts that have been proposed either for BitShares or for other blockchains or services in terms of the elements that have been defined above. This is intended to provide some background and comparison to the concepts that follow.

**To-do**: Elaborate Interledger

## **Existing Graphene Features that are Similar to What is Needed for Blockchain Escrowing**

### **Bitshares Escrow**

A separate BSIP is currently being discussed that provides a more traditional escrow service. This involves parties, agents, and a more complex evaluation. HTLC shares some similarities, and could be considered a thin subset of Bitshares Escrow.

The smaller, well-defined nature of HTLC provides a major advantage for applications that want to attempt tasks such as cross chain atomic swaps.

### **BitShares Multi-Signature Account**

One of the existing features of BitShares is the ability to have an account that requires multiples signatures by differently authorized parties [cite] and even hierarchical authorizations. Using this mechanism as a form of escrow is possible. But there are many limitations. More information on escrow and multi-signatures can be found in the Bitshares Escrow BSIP.

### **BitShares Proposals**

One of the existing features of BitShares is the ability to have a proposal that is recorded on the blockchain and awaits the authorization of the requisite parties (e.g. M-of-N signatures). If the required authorizations are not given by the proposal expiry then no transfer will occur. This feature also contains many limitations when compared to HTLC.

# **Specifications**

## **Possible Concepts to Implement**

The following will describe possible concepts that could be implemented in BitShares.

### **Set-Price Swap**

Two parties may agree on an asset swap at a set price, without using the exchange. Two HTLC contracts with the same hash can provide a trustless exchange of assets

#### **Business Approach**

Party A (Alice) generates an HTLC with a preimage of her choice. The contract stipulates that she will deposit 100 bitUSD into the account of Party B (Bob), if he provides the preimage that generates the stored hash before 10AM tomorrow. She then shares the contract identifier with Bob.

Bob examines the contract Alice created, being sure to examine that the receiving account, the amount, and the timeout agrees with his desires. He then generates another HTLC that will deposit 10,000 bitshares into the account of Alice, if she provides the preimage that generates the same hash before 5pm today. He then shares the contract identifier with Alice.

Alice now examines the contract Bob created, being sure to examine that the receiving account, the amount, and the timeout agrees with her desires. She also verifies that the hash matches the hash of her contract. She now uses her preimage to "unlock" Bob's contract, which puts 10,000 bitshares into her account. This also posts the preimage on the BitShares blockchain. NOTE: She must do this before 5PM. Otherwise, Bob may (and should) reclaim the funds in the contract he created.

Bob can now see the preimage that Alice used to receive her bitshares, and he can use the same preimage to "unlock" the contract Alice created, and receive the 100 bitUSD. NOTE: He must do this before 10AM tomorrow. Otherwise, Alice may (and should) reclaim the funds in the contract she created.

### **Cross-Chain Swap**

The set-price swap mentioned above works the same across chains that support HTLC. Bitcoin, as an example, supports HTLC.

#### **Business Approach**

Alice generates an HTLC on the Bitshares blockchain with a preimage of her choice. The contract stipulates that she will deposit 1 bitBTC into the account of Bob, if he provides the preimage that generates the stored hash before 10AM tomorrow. She then shares the contract identifier with Bob.

Bob examines the contract Alice created, being sure to examine that the receiving account, the amount, and the timeout agrees with his desires. He then generates an HTLC that will deposit 1 BTC into the Bitcoin address of Alice, if she provides the preimage that generates the same hash before 5pm today. He then shares the Bitcoin transaction identifier with Alice.

Alice now examines the contract Bob created, being sure to examine that the receiving account, the amount, and the timeout agrees with her desires. She also verifies that the hash matches the hash of her contract. She now uses her preimage to "unlock" Bob's contract, which puts 1 BTC into her Bitcoin wallet. This also posts the preimage on the Bitcoin blockchain. NOTE: She must do this before 5PM. Otherwise, Bob may (and should) reclaim the funds in the contract he created.

Bob can now see the preimage that Alice used to receive her Bitcoin, and he can use the same preimage to "unlock" the contract Alice created, and receive the 1 bitBTC. NOTE: He must do this before 10AM tomorrow. Otherwise, Alice may (and should) reclaim the funds in the contract she created.
